Given a complete directed  graph, Floyd-Warshall's algorithm \textsuperscript{\ref{alg:sequential}} can be used to compute the shortest paths from all vertices to all vertices.
When applying the sequential version of the algorithm, the solution is reached with a complexity of $O(n\textsuperscript{3})$, with n as number of vertices.
Unlike Dijkstra's algorithm for the shortest path problem, Floyd-Warshall's algorithm can also be used in case of negative costs and can identify the presence of negative cycles 
(even thought the correctness of the algorithm is not guaranteed in such cases).

\cite{fischetti}
The algorithm takes in input an adjacency matrix of $n \times n$  distances $d[i,j]$ with $i,j \in V$ and $n$ number of vertices representing an oriented graph, and as output it returns two matrices:
\begin{itemize}
    \item a distance cost matrix where $d[i,j]$ is the cost of the shortest path from \textit{i} to \textit{j}
    \item a predecessor matrix where $pred[i,j]$ is the predecessor of j in the shortest path from \textit{i} to \textit{j}
  \end{itemize}

The overall algorithm works by testing every intermediate vertex h to find the shortest path from a vertex \textit{i} to a vertex \textit{j},
comparing the new path cost with the current one (best so far).

\begin{equation}
    d[i,j] = min\left\{ d[i,j], d[i,h]+d[h,j] \right\}
\end{equation}



\begin{algorithm}
    \For{\(i \in [1,n]\)}{
        \For{\(j \in [1,n]\)}{
            initialize \( d [ i , j ] \leftarrow c [ i , j ] \) and pred \( [ i , j ]  \leftarrow i \)
        }
    }
    \For{\(h\in [1,n]\)} {
        \For{\(i \in [1,n]\)} {
            \For{\(j \in [1,n]\)}{
                \If{\( d [ i , h ] + d [ h , j ] < d [ i , j ] \)} {
                    \( d [ i , j ] \leftarrow d [ i , h ] + d [ h , j ] \)
                    \( pred [ i , j ] \leftarrow pred [ h , j ] \)
                }
            }
        }
        \For{\(i \in [1,n]\)} {
            \If{\(d[i,i]< 0\)} {
                STOP  "negative cycles"
            }
        }
    }
