    The Floyd-Warshall algorithm deals with the calculation of the shortest paths from all vertices to all vertices. The algorithm has a complexity of \(O(n^3)\) when there are \(n\) vertices.
    In this project, we would see our own solution for the parallelization of the algorithm by means of divide and conquer and an execution with squares inscribed inside other squares.
