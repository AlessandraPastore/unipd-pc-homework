    The Floyd-Warshall algorithm deals with the calculation of the shortest paths from all vertices to all vertices. The sequential algorithm has a complexity of \(O(n^3)\) when there are \(n\) vertices.
    In this project, we analyze our own solution for the parallelization of the algorithm by means of the Divide-and-conquer strategy and an execution with squares inscribed inside other squares.
