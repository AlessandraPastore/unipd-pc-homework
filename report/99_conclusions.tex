\section{Conclusion}
We have seen an implementation of a parallel version of floyd-warshall based on a 2D torus or circular matrix topology, theoretically this implementation should give very good results, the basic problem remains the synchronisation times, which analysed in \cref{trivial_parallelization} and we have studied a way to minimise them in \cref{squared-parallelization} are still too high to give decent results.

These results are in line with the current scientific literature in the field of  Floyd-Warshall parallelisation.
